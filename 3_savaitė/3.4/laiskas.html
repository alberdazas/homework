        <div id="vardas">Dear Jason,</div>

        <div>
            <p>I’m writing to resign from my position as customer service representative, effective August 14, 2020.</p>

            <p>I’ve recently decided to go back to school, and my program starts in early September. I’m tendering my
                resignation now so that I can be as helpful as possible to you during the transition.</p>

            <p>I’ve truly enjoyed my time working with you and everyone else on our team at LMK. It’s rare to find a
                customer service role that offers as much opportunity to grow and learn, as well as such a positive,
                inspiring team of people to grow and learn with.</p>

            <p>I’m particularly grateful for your guidance while I was considering furthering my education. Your support
                has meant so much to me.</p>

            <p>Please let me know if there’s anything I can do to help you find and train my replacement.</p>
        </div>
        <div id="atsisveikinimas">Thanks, and best wishes,</div>
